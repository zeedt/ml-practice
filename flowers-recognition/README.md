### Flower Recognition

This project is for flower identification. These flowers include rose, daisy, dandellion, sunflower and tulip. To goto the Kaggle competition, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)
The training data are images (4242 in  number) and CNN is used for this classification. The data was augmented and transfer learning was used for this task. After implementation, some random data were picked online and the trained model was used to make prediction. 

Some predictions were wrong and this is because most of the images used are not images that are glaring to identify like the ones in the training data.
The images were used have the flowers in different context. e.g some are far away and tiny etc. 

Below is the prediction made with labels (indicating if wrong)

**Note** : There is still room for improvements on my CNN model for this flower recognition task.


Cheers.
