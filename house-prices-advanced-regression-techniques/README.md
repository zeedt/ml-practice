### House Prices (Advanced Regression Techniques) 

This project is about house price prediction based on some house and environment related features provided. These variables are 79 in numbers and are mix of both categorical and numerical variables. Different regression techniques are used in solving this including ElasticNet, GradientBoostingRegressor, SelectKBest, Neural network etc. To goto the Kaggle competition, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

The major reason for this project is to explore several regression techniques. Out of my predictions with different models, the prediction done with neural network performed best out with Root Mean Squared Logarithmatic Error of 0.12896 on Kaggle .

 Below is the Accuracy/Loss plot during training.
